# Project  Titile 
Social-Media-Engagement-Analysis


# Project Overview:

This project analyzes engagement trends across Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter over a 31-day period using Power BI. The focus areas include trend analysis, sentiment modeling, and content virality. Through interactive dashboards and KPI cards, the project uncovers platform-specific engagement patterns, sentiment distribution in user comments, and the performance of different content types. The insights help identify high-performing content strategies and optimal posting times to enhance social media effectiveness.

# Analysis Performed:

1. Trend Analysis:

Time-Series Engagement Analysis – Tracked daily engagement levels across Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to identify peak days.
Weekday Performance Analysis – Analyzed engagement patterns by day of the week to determine the most active and engaging days.

2. Sentiment Modeling:

Sentiment Classification – Categorized user comments into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments to understand audience tone.
Monthly Sentiment Trends – Tracked sentiment distribution across months to evaluate shifts in user perception and emotional response.

3. Content Virality & KPIs: 

Content-Type Performance Analysis – Evaluated engagement by post type (image, video, carousel, text, etc.) to find the most viral formats.
Virality & Engagement KPIs – Measured total engagement, virality score, and sentiment metrics using KPI cards for quick performance insights.

# Objectives of the project:

1. To understand user engagement patterns across Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
2. To identify high-impact days and times for content publishing.
3. To compare post frequency and engagement trends by platform.
4. To explore what content or behaviors contribute to viral trends and sustained engagement.
5. To analyze and classify user comments based on sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) in order to understand audience perception and emotional response to social media content.

# Tools Used:
Power BI for data cleaning, analysis, and creating interactive dashboards and visual reports.

# Key Leanings:

1. Instagram had the highest engagement levels, especially on Wednesdays and Thursdays, making it the most impactful platform for audience interaction.
2. User sentiment was predominantly positive, with nearly half of the sentiment-tagged comments showing favorable reactions, which suggests good content resonance.
3. Post frequency influenced engagement trends, with higher posting activity midweek aligning with peak engagement across platforms.
4. Carousel and video posts drove the most engagement, highlighting that interactive and visual content formats tend to perform better.
5. Virality scores and engagement metrics peaked simultaneously, showing that highly engaging content also tends to spread rapidly, especially on Instagram.

# Questions 

The following questions guided the structure and design of the Power BI dashboard for this Social Media Engagement Analysis project. The analysis focused on three core areas: Trend Analysis, Sentiment Modeling, and Content Virality, supported by key performance indicators (KPIs).

A. Trend Analysis:

1. Prepare a trend analysis to visualize how user engagement evolved daily across Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
2. Show post frequency per day of the week to identify patterns in platform-specific content publishing behavior.

B. Sentiment Modeling:

1. Prepare a sentiment modeling view to classify comments by sentiment score (positive, neutral, negative) across months.
2. Show a distribution of post types by sentiment to examine how content tone affects audience perception.

C.  Content Virality & KPIs ( Key Performance Indicators):

1. Prepare a KPI dashboard to display total engagement (likes, comments, shares) across all platforms.
2. Show a card with virality score to evaluate how widely and quickly content spread across platforms.
3. Prepare a content-type vs. engagement analysis to highlight which format (image, text, video, carousel) drove the most engagement by month.
4. Prepare sentiment KPIs showing total sentiment count and number of positive sentiments captured during the analysis.
